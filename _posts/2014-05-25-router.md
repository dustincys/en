Every people in HIT knows there is no free Internet on this campus which is a so-called member of [C9 League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C9_League "C9 League").
People in HIT want to get access to Internet in dorm needs to register a Ruijie account with student ID and room number, then the wired (unfortunately, the official Wi-fi signal "HIT-WLAN" is unreachable in any dormitory) Internet access will be opened in 24 hours with the default password "123456".
Windows user needs to install [Ruijie client software](http://ito.hit.edu.cn/news/sub_bgxz.asp?id=280) , while Linux/Unix (Ubuntu/MAC) user needs to install [mentohust](http://yanshuo.name/en/2013/09/network/ "mentohust").
Disgustingly, the Ruijie server will remember the mac address first connected to Internet of every Ruijie account, and post warning to the computer with inconsistent network and system mac address.
This monopolistic system makes every student who wants to use Internet have no alternative but register a Ruijie account and pay 30 yuan every month.

So if you are new here, don't be terrified, don't be intimidated, because there is always reason here in term of money.
Nevertheless, It is still possible to setup a router to share Internet with multiple devices.
The key is HiWiFi!
All your needs are the 3 steps below.

1. Buy a HiWiFi router from <http://www.jd.com>.
2. Connect the wires the same as normal router.
3. Router configuration.
	- Load the setup page (it will be automatically loaded while open brower)

	- Select the DHCP for WLAN setting.

	- Clone mac address. The mac address text field is in the list of advanced setting.

	- Input the information of Ruijie account at a secret page: <http://192.168.199.1/cgi-bin/turbo/admin_web/plugin/mentohust>.

Actually, HiWiFi is embedded with mentohust which sends pulse package to keep Ruijie server from shutting corresponding account off.
