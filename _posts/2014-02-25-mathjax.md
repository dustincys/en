Sometimes, it is not appropriate to place the script line in the `<head>` section.

{% highlight HTML %}
<script type="text/javascript"
   src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

This website, as an example, every page use the same head template.
Only part of pages employ MathJax script to render math equation, let alone the homepage and index page neither of which contains equation. 
Routine client (I guess) loads this website in this sequence: [homepage](http://yanshuo.name "my home page") --> [index page](http://yanshuo.name/cn "Chinese blog, for example") --> [post page](http://yanshuo.name/cn/2014/02/dirichlet/ "one post in Chinese blog").
While browser is loading index page, it begins to load MathJax script which is a causative bumpy loading factor.
Put MathJax into `<body>` section of pages with equation, is not a bad option.

Like the other modules of Jekyll, put MathJax code piece in file `_include/mathjax.html`, then, add the corresponding `if` judgement in `_layout/post.html` as following,

<script src="https://gist.github.com/dustincys/a259fef4292ab8c8a958.js"></script>

Both the above two steps are easy, but the next flowing step is quite laborious, which needs every name of file with equation in it.
