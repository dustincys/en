Semantic similarity was coming out with the measurement of English language similarity base on [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/), a lexical database with hierarchical tree-like structure (only has the is\_a relationship).
Methods and theories proposed at that time focused on tree structure, rather than directed acyclic graph (DAG).
To some extent, WordNet is a special kind of ontology, according to the standard listed in Gruber et al (1993, A translation approach to portable ontology specifications).
While people tried to apply tree-based theories and methods to measure the similarity of genes based on gene ontology term, some of the definition leads to ambiguity because the general form of ontology is DAG.
One of the ambiguous definition is the common ancestor type.

![common ancestor type](https://2s66lw.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pTqOMA4rUgIXLOgSgW77aLs_1ib6Fj-oq7lGMdeiYiT-ccjfgcM7uH0XIzVFxUr4zsGsOA-hnUUufMhX7M-SG2mE3i0KamAM8Ajg6BrXiCvo/canodetype.jpg "common ancestor type")

Here, the most recent common ancestor (green node) of \\(c\_1\\) and \\(c\_2\\) is no longer the least common ancestor (red node) in DAG, and the most informative common ancestor (purple node) either.
In fact, the definition of the least common ancestor in DAG becomes a blur, since any node could have a edge connect to any ancestor.
Two terms, \\(c\_1\\) and \\(c\_2\\), each of them could possibly has two path to root, let's say, \\(p\_{1,c\_1}\\), \\(p\_{2,c\_1}\\), \\(p\_{1,c\_2}\\), \\(p\_{2,c\_2}\\) , if
$$p\_{1,c\_1} > p\_{1,c\_2}> p\_{2,c\_2} > p\_{2,c\_1} $$,
then, which one is the least common ancestor?
