To build and maintain a personal blog website is really amazing, really fascinating.
Here I am going to talk something about jekyll blog hosted by GitHub.
I have puzzled over these following questions about this blog for a long time. 

1. How to automatically create blog file with date prefix?
2. How to add the jekyll head in blog file automatically?
3. How to change the tags into lowercase automatically?

In fact, just need these two tiny commands to solve question 1 and 3, it works well.

To add jekyll head automatically while composing blog post, just utilize the snippet function of some decent editors.
Such as Vim and Sublime Text, both of them have the snippet function, which could pop out small pieces of code previously customized.
Here is the content of snippet file for this blog post.
