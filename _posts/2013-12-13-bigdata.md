Perhaps, nobody hasn't heard of this prevalent word 'big data' right now.
Big data captured attentions of people ranged all the fields these years.  
It is so mysterious, it is so fascinating, and it is so stunning, like human look up at fine night, intoxicated by the starry scenery, exclamatory of its vastness. 

To most people awakened from the daze of big data, the instinctive response, is going to update the computer, replace with more cores CPU, larger RAM and so on. 

As the scale of data accumulated into astronomical figure, redundant and noise data also burst.
Traditional approach to analyse this myriad data is no longer suitable, it is not the problem of processing power but the methodological problem. 
It is like, we looking at the IMAX movie screen in cinema, we can't receive all the information in a flash, but when we finished watching the whole movie, we could get the general skeleton of the plot of the movie.
And that should be the right way to reckon the methodology of big data, which is, to track, spot the pattern, then locate the specific vital point and zoom in, and it could make decision and picture the plot.
